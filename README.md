# Pressure Diffusivity with PDE Method

In this section, the user is asked to input the values of variables that have been determined. The required variables are:
* **Porosity**            = the percentage of the total rock volume consisting of pore space or open space (fraction)

* **Permeability**        = the ability of the rock to allow fluids to flow (mD)

* **Viscosity**           = a measure of the fluids thickness (cP)

* **Compressibility**     = the ability of a material to undergo volume changes when subjected to pressure (1/psi)

* **Length (r)**          = the distance between the injection well and the production well (ft)

* **n (i)**               = the number of sections into which the rock sample is divided

* **dx**                  = distance between each section (ft)

* **dt**                  = time  (hour)

* **nt**                  = interval per time step

* **Injection Pressure**  = the pressure of the injected fluid (psi)

* **Initial Pressure**    = the initial fluid pressure in the reservoir (psi)

* **Production Pressure** = the fluid pressure desired during production (psi)
